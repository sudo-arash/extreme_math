# Extreme Math

Welcome to **Extreme Math**! This is a fun and challenging math game where your task is to solve **simple linear equations** for the famous little \( x \). Test your skills and see how many equations you can solve correctly!

## Features
- **Randomized Equations**: Each equation is unique, generated with random coefficients and constants.
- **Integer Solutions Only**: No need to worry about decimalsâ€”just simple and clean integer answers.
- **Replayability**: Play as many rounds as you want. Each time, you'll face a new equation to solve.

## How to Play
1. **Run the Game**: Compile and run the game using any C++ compiler.
2. **Solve the Equation**: The game will present you with a linear equation in the form of \( ax + b = c \).
3. **Enter Your Answer**: Type in your answer for \( x \) and press Enter.
4. **Get Feedback**: The game will tell you if your answer is correct or incorrect.
5. **Play Again**: After each round, you can choose to play again or exit the game.

## Example
```plaintext
Solve for x: 4x + 1 = 9
Your answer: 2
Correct! Well done.

Do you want to play again? (y/n): y

Solve for x: 3x + 7 = 10
Your answer: 1
Correct! Well done.

Do you want to play again? (y/n): n

Thanks for playing!
```

## Requirements
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Basic knowledge of C++ to compile and run the program

## Compilation and Running
To compile the game, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
g++ -o extreme_math main.cpp
```

Then, to run the game, use:

```bash
./extreme_math
```
## Todo
> I would love to make this game cooler and I am trying to do so! I planned on making a GUI for this game. Although I guess it can take a while. So, I will be happy to see you guys helping me out making the GUI for this!
